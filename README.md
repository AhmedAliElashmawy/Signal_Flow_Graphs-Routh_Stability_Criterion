## PHASE I : *Signal Flow Graphs*

This Draws the signal flow graph and computes the following :

- All forward loops.
- individual loops.
- Combinations of $n$ non-touching loops.
- Values of $Δ$ , $Δ_1$ , ..., $Δ_m$ , where $m$ is the number of forward paths.
- The system's overall transfer function $\frac{INPUT}{OUTPUT}$
